## Notes
The Allison in this story is fictional, but her challenges are real. As an independent contributor AI Experience Designer in the product team, I've designed the solution using generative technology that transforms how auditors compile reports — from days to minutes.

Mock data replaces actual information to safeguard confidentiality. The value delivered to audit teams is 100% authentic.

## Meet Allison
Allison's blank document stares back at her, the cursor blinking like a timer counting down billable hours. "Where should I start gathering all these findings?" she sighs, five minutes into her standoff with an empty draft.

This isn't just Allison's problem. Across audit firms, professionals drown in information scattered across platforms and formats — client details, meeting notes, and evidence documents living in digital diaspora. The struggle continues after completing audit fieldwork, when findings have to be reported back to the client.

## Fast and Factually Correct
"The ask is simple — we need a way to trace findings back to their original source," says Allison. Client questions and partner reviews demand instant evidence to back up every claim.

When engagements grow complex, team members must become reference librarians on the fly, pulling precise citations from a digital labyrinth of documents. For each finding, Allison needs to recall exactly which file, which page, which paragraph contains the supporting evidence.

As engagements balloon with data, this mental mapping becomes unsustainable. What should be a simple "here's where we found this" turns into a frustrating treasure hunt through folders and files — the digital equivalent of searching for a specific sentence in a library without an index.

> "I used to spend entire afternoons just gathering material for a single section, now I complete full first drafts before lunch, with available issues properly backed and traceable." — Allison.

## Acheive The First 40% in Minutes
The solution leverages advanced natural language processing to analyze thousands of pages of audit evidence, automatically extracting key findings while maintaining links to source documents throughout the process. This isn't just a search function—it's a comprehensive knowledge layer that understands audit contexts and relationships.

Here's how it works for Allison:

- When preparing her draft, she inputs current fieldwork findings, and the AI generates a curated list of suggested findings for review, optimally combining them for clarity
- Each suggestion includes a complete paragraph explaining the finding in detail
- With a single click within the draft, she can verify sources and incorporate citations directly through the plug-in
- The system automatically handles report formats and compliance standards, managing structure and formatting so Allison can focus exclusively on delivering valuable insights

The Microsoft Word plug-in features a clean sidebar for requesting and reviewing clarifications without disrupting workflow. This add-in integrates seamlessly with her familiar tools—no switching between applications or learning complex new systems required.

The impact has been substantial and measurable after a limited beta testing:

- Reduced reports compilation time by 80% (from 16 hours to just 3 hours for reviewable drafts)
- Decreased citation errors by 70% during partner review
- Doubled speed on identifying the required issues to be raised in the Management Letter.

## Scaling Up
While the solution initially targeted risk auditors, its success has accelerated adoption plans across the organization. Our implementation roadmap now includes:

- External auditor (Q4 2025)
- Internal auditors (Q2 2026)

Each new domain requires specialized training data and domain-specific citation models developed collaboratively with subject matter experts, incorporating prior years' documents to train the model for a broader audience.
