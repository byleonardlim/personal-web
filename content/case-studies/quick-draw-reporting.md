## Notes
The Allison in this story is fictional, but her challenges are real. As an independent contributor AI Experience Designer in the product team, I've designed the solution using generative technology that transforms how auditors compile reports — from days to minutes.

While all information is white-labeled, the value delivered to audit teams is 100% authentic.

## Meet Allison
Allison's blank document stares back at her, the cursor blinking like a timer counting down billable hours. "Where should I start gathering all these findings?" she sighs, five minutes into her standoff with an empty draft.

This isn't just Allison's problem. Across audit firms, professionals drown in information scattered across platforms and formats — client details, meeting notes, and evidence documents living in digital diaspora. Every fragment contains gold for the final report, but mining it? That's the real work.

## Fast and Factually Correct
"The ask is simple — we need a way to trace findings back to their original source," says Allison. Client questions and partner reviews demand instant evidence to back up every claim.

When engagements grow complex, team members must become reference librarians on the fly, pulling precise citations from a digital labyrinth of documents. For each finding, Allison needs to recall exactly which file, which page, which paragraph contains the supporting evidence.

As engagements balloon with data, this mental mapping becomes unsustainable. What should be a simple "here's where we found this" turns into a frustrating treasure hunt through folders and files — the digital equivalent of searching for a specific sentence in a library without an index.


## Acheive The First 40% in Minutes
The solution leverages advanced natural language processing to analyze thousands of pages of audit evidence, automatically extracting key findings and maintaining links to their source documents throughout the process. This isn't just a search function—it's a comprehensive knowledge layer that understands audit contexts and relationships.

Here's how it works for Allison:

- As she begins drafting a finding, the AI proactively suggests relevant evidence from across the document repository
- Each suggestion displays the exact paragraph and surrounding context, with confidence scores based on relevance
- With a single click, she can verify the source and incorporate the citation, maintaining a complete audit trail
- The system learns required report formats and compliance standards, automatically handling structure and formatting so Allison can focus exclusively on delivering valuable insights to clients.

The Microsoft Word plug-in features a clean sidebar showing color-coded evidence cards that Allison can quickly review without breaking her workflow. The add-in integrates seamlessly with her familiar tools, no switching between applications or learning complex new systems.

> "I used to spend entire afternoons just gathering material for a single section, now I complete full first drafts before lunch, with available issues properly backed and traceable." — Allison.

The impact has been substantial and measurable:

- During limited beta testing, report compilation time decreased by 80%, transforming a 16-hour drafting process into just over 3 hours to produce a reviewable draft.
- Teams have seen a 70% reduction in citation errors during partner review.
- Auditors can now process 2x faster per engagement on identifying the required issues to be raised in the Management Letter.

## Scaling Up
While the solution initially targeted risk auditors, its success has accelerated adoption plans across the organization. Our implementation roadmap now includes:

- External auditor (Q4 2025)
- Internal auditors (Q2 2026)

Each new domain requires specialized training data and domain-specific citation models developed collaboratively with subject matter experts, incorporating prior years' documents to train the model for a broader audience.
